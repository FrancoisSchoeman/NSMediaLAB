# Welcome to NS MediaLAB

Ever wondered what happens when a developer husband tries to express love? They build a website! Welcome to NS MediaLAB, the brainchild of love, coffee, and countless "This should work...why doesn't it work?" moments. This site is not just any site; it's a testament to my wife's incredible social media marketing business and my attempt to win some serious husband points.

## What's Cooking in This Love Potion?

This site is marinated with a blend of modern tech ingredients, sure to make any developer's heart skip a beat (or throw an unexpected error):

- **Next.js**: Because who doesn't love adding more `js` to their diet?
- **TypeScript**: It's like JavaScript, but with a tie.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For when you want to style your components and your hair is already perfect.
- **shadcn/ui**: Because I needed UI components that just work, and my design skills are as good as my cooking - edible but best not discussed.
- **React Lottie Player**: Bringing animations to life, unlike my attempts at house plants.
- **Recharts**: For when my wife asks, "Can we see our growth in pretty graphs?" and I want to say, "Yes!"

## Get This Party Started

### Setting Up the Stage

First, ensure you've got the latest and greatest Node.js and npm/yarn. If you're like ThePrimeagen, you probably have these installed before your morning coffee. If not, it's never too late to join the cool developers' club.

### Installation

Clone this repository, as one does:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FrancoisSchoeman/NSMediaLAB.git
cd NSMediaLAB
```

Install the dependencies, and maybe make a cup of coffee while you're at it:

```bash
npm install
# or for the yarn lovers
yarn
```

### Running the Development Server

Launch the server and watch the magic unfold:

```bash
npm run dev
# or if you're fancy
yarn dev
```

Now, the site should be up and running on http://localhost:3000. It's like seeing your child take their first steps, but with less crying and more debugging.

### Building for Production

When it's time to show the world (or at least my wife) the fruits of your labor:

```bash
npm run build
# yarn folks, you know the drill
yarn build
```

Followed by:

```bash
npm start
# or yes, yarn start
```

Because why enjoy a quiet evening when you can stress about deployment?

### A Word to ThePrimeagen

Hey ThePrimeagen, while you're out there breaking Vim speed records, remember, not all of us can refactor life with a keyboard. But hey, at least I can build a website for my wife without having to exit Vim... I think.

### Parting Words

If you've made it this far, remember, behind every great website there's a developer googling "How to center a div." Cheers to the journey, the bugs, the fixes, and to my wife, who hopefully now believes that marrying a developer was a good idea. After all, who else can automate Instagram posts and break the website at the same time?

Here's to love, code, and the occasional `undefined is not a function`!
